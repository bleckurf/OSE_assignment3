## Description

Third assignment in Open source energy system modeling.

The repository consists of:

- westeros_added_solarPV.ipyndb: notebook based on tutorial westeros_baseline.ipyndb. A solar power plant is included in the energy mix.
- westeros_solar_ppl_emissions_bounds_800: notebook with emission bounds added to the model
- westeros_solar_ppl_emissions_bounds_500: notebook with limited emission bounds added to the model
- westeros_solar_ppl_emissions_bounds_250: notebook with further limited emission bounds
